'''
this file will house the lineage of classes derived from sprite,
allowing us to group them into different branches based on function, interaction, and behavior.
Hopefuly this will a sufficient degree of control over how the entities within the game interact.
note that I will be transitioning over into different size multipliers and image formats, so the code
below presumes the existence of spritesheets for animation purposes

'''
this details the basic structure of inheritance for every type of sprite we'll be using, and holds all the generic methods that we intend to 
pass downwards via inheritance to more specialized classes. basically, if you plan to use a particular method many times for many different sprites,
find the common ancestor of all the sprites that you want to have access to the method, and define it for the ancestor.
ex: entity is the common ancestor of all our sprite(s/classes), so to give all sprites access to a method, simply define it for the entity class
