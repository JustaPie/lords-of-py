'''
this file will house the lineage of classes derived from sprite,
allowing us to group them into different branches based on function, interaction, and behavior.
Hopefuly this will a sufficient degree of control over how the entities within the game interact.
note that I will be transitioning over into different size multipliers and image formats, so the code
below presumes the existence of spritesheets for animation purposes

'''
confession: I'm not too great with python-based OOP, so I'm not sure if this level of division/inheritance is strictly necessary, 
but it does help me personally concepualize everything
